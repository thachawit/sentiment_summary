2023-02-01 23:59:03+00:00,sydney_ev,"im good with it, as long as ALL #Ev drivers using these, including Tesla drivers, only charge to what they need to get to where they need to go, and not sit and wait for 100%",
2023-02-02 02:23:05+00:00,maddogeco,,@sydney_ev What‚Äôs the etiquette. What you need to get to the next charger plus a bit more incase that charger is broken?
2023-02-02 02:24:36+00:00,sydney_ev,,"@maddogeco if the charger is broken, and you need more to get past that, then charge what you need.    when you sitting at say Heatherbrae, and heading to Sydney, you dont need 100%, when you will arrive in Sydney, easily with 50% or more."
2023-02-02 02:53:38+00:00,bradtainton,,"@sydney_ev I don't think there is an issue with charging to 100% even if you don't need it for your next drive. You're paying for the service, so charge away.  Excluding times when its crazy busy or sitting there after its finished charging, idle fees can help reduce that anyway"
2023-02-02 03:02:53+00:00,NeilBoltonRSPL,,"@bradtainton @sydney_ev If there are spare bays, then occupying one to trickle those last few electrons in isn't a problem. If it's a busy charger, then i's a big problem."
2023-02-02 03:00:36+00:00,NeilBoltonRSPL,,@sydney_ev Depends on the car/battery type. My Model Y can still charge pretty fast at 98%. My 2019 Stealth is bloody slow above 85%.
2023-02-02 00:09:35+00:00,robrobdean,,@sydney_ev I 100% agree
2023-02-02 01:06:48+00:00,1_bstevens,,"@sydney_ev They‚Äôll wait for 100%
Old petrol station habit until they learn about the charging curve."
2023-02-02 01:34:11+00:00,dwhes,,@sydney_ev There is 0 chance of that occurring. We already saw it all summer. People don‚Äôt understand that EVs are a different way of driving. I saw so many going well above 80% SOC when they were very unlikely to need to. Now we will have slow charging EVs doing so at SCs.
2023-02-02 04:32:01+00:00,nqctltb,,"@sydney_ev When Tesla rolls out /enables robot axis, with Dojo, it will optimize the time to charge enough for next destination, with built-in intelligence on surrendering SC. This becomes a resource planning project."
2023-02-02 09:00:16+00:00,lklundin,,@sydney_ev The Superchargers where I charge my #Tesla will stop the charging session at 80% SoC if the station starts to fill up.

2023-02-05 20:00:05+00:00,thedebrieft,,"1. In a major win for Elon Musk, a jury rejected investor claims that he violated federal securities law when he tweeted in 2018 about potentially taking Tesla private."
2023-02-05 20:00:05+00:00,thedebrieft,,2. The nine-person jury found that the investors who brought the class-action case failed to prove their claims against Mr. Musk or the electric-car company he runs.
2023-02-05 20:00:05+00:00,thedebrieft,,"3. The case stems from the Tesla CEO‚Äôs tweets more than four years ago proposing to take the company private.
4. During the trial, Tesla board members had sought to distance themselves from Mr. Musk, saying that he was tweeting in his personal capacity."

2023-02-09 23:35:02+00:00,HarshilBhimani7,,"@Tesla CEO @elonmusk  had a vision: to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. But before he could do that, he needed to determine the size of his potential market."
2023-02-09 23:35:02+00:00,HarshilBhimani7,,"He started by identifying his target market: consumers looking for environmentally-friendly, high-performance vehicles. From there, he estimated the total number of people who fit that description, and voila! He had his Total Addressable Market."
2023-02-09 23:35:02+00:00,HarshilBhimani7,,"Armed with this knowledge, Tesla was able to make informed decisions about their growth strategy. They focused on expanding into markets with the largest TAM and quickly became one of the most recognizable and successful companies in the automotive industry."
2023-02-09 23:35:03+00:00,HarshilBhimani7,,And it's not just about sales. Understanding their TAM also helped Tesla identify potential competition and figure out how to differentiate their product. They disrupted the traditional automotive industry by offering electric vehicles with cutting-edge technology and design.
2023-02-09 23:35:03+00:00,HarshilBhimani7,,"So, the moral of the story is this: Total Addressable Market is a crucial tool for entrepreneurs. It can help you make informed decisions, set realistic goals, and ultimately, succeed in the marketplace."

2023-02-11 20:55:57+00:00,bradsferguson,"üö®WARNING: There are likely 100,000+ who recently started buying Tesla once it was up 20% from its $104 bottom üßµüëá(more)

Why do we think this? For one, there was $2 BILLION net retail $TSLA buying over a 5-day period recently (source: Twitter). This means that there was $2 billion more in retail buys than sells.

Many bought $TSLA stonk purely on stonk price momentum (momo) and b/c ‚Äúthe chart told me to buy.‚Äù (technical analysis or TA). We believe these momo & TA gamblers will bail completely on $TSLA when the stonk goes down enough to scare them.

Why will the exposed gamblers bail? They are just playing the stonk price, bro. They have no conviction. If they don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúprice action,‚Äù they are out. They know nothing about the fundamentals of the company. They are not long-term. They will bail imo if they are having a bad day.

What am I saying? If TA & momo gamblers were a big piece of demand recently for shares, they can just as easily supply their shares (sell) back to the market. In the absence of an incremental buyer. It could temporarily weigh down the price.

Perhaps instead of buying every 5% $TSLA dip, maybe wait to see if the weak hands get flushed first? Many folks are suddenly getting excited about the stonk but other words for this are FOMO and greed. Might be an opportunity to add at a bigger discount.

You got to the point you are now by not following the crowd, going against Wall Street, and avoiding cookie cutter advice. You got here by rebelling, just like Elon.

What Rebellionaires know is that you want to be purposefully agile and not follow rules of thumb like ‚Äújust buy the dip.‚Äù You want sustainability for your finances in contrast with our unsustainable world.

If you want to know more about how we help Rebellionaires create their own Masterplan, make their finances sustainable, and scale their dreams into exponential impact, DM me ‚ÄúRebellionaire.‚Äù I will get back to you soon.

2023-02-11 21:17:40+00:00,applelinux,,"@bradsferguson Great point, but the real question is how far down the dip can be, under 100 to scare the weak hands?"

Dan O'Dowd is sitting on the couch, staring at the TV. He's watching a news segment about a recent accident that was narrowly avoided thanks to Tesla's Full Self-Driving Beta technology.

Suddenly, the front door bursts open and Dan's wife, Amy Chang O'Dowd, and their two children run in, out of breath and visibly shaken.

AMY: Dan, you won't believe what just happened!

2023-02-11 18:59:20+00:00,OwenSparks_,"EXPLAINED: Tesla Magic Dock ‚ö°Ô∏è 

Magic Dock is how all electric vehicles will be able to utilize the Tesla Supercharging Network, the most reliable charging network in North America, with just one cable.

This is how it works:

For Teslas: The experience is the same, the cable easily unlatches from the station and you plug in.

For CCS vehicles: When unlatching the cable from the station, it locks to a NACS-CCS adapter, allowing you to charge.

The adapter is always locked, either to the Magic Dock or to the NACS connector.

In normal use it will be locked to the Magic Dock and will just act as a cable holder, but when a CCS vehicle needs to charge it locks to the NACS connector and unlocks from the Magic Dock.

This relatively simple retrofit will allow Tesla to expand their charging network even further with the use of government funding, helping to accelerate the transition to a sustainable future for all.

NOTE:

This is just speculation based on a leaked image of the Magic Dock in the Tesla App first caught by @brandenflasch and reported by @DriveTeslaca. 

(If the animation / steps involved is incorrect, please let me know @elonmusk).",

In normal state the adapter isn't locked to the cable, so when a Tesla pulls up they just take it out like normal."

2023-02-13 23:53:42+00:00,Erik_Lutes,,How is this marketing? There are so many Superchargers in the U.S. non-Tesla owner will soon start cross shopping Teslas when it comes time to buy/lease again seeing as they will be spending most their time utilizing their charging equipment.

2023-02-13 23:53:43+00:00,Erik_Lutes,,A perfect picture of this is here in my own market of Indianapolis. In order to go from Indianapolis to Chicago you travel along I65. Tesla has a total of 56 charging stalls along that stretch of interstate divided between 4 sites
2023-02-13 23:53:43+00:00,Erik_Lutes,,(with a 5th site of 8 stalls slated to open in a few months). The only other option for DCFCing is the halfway point in Lafayette Indiana where Electrify America has a 4 stall install.
2023-02-13 23:53:44+00:00,Erik_Lutes,,"Yes, you read that correctly and have done the math right. Tesla has over 50 more opportunities for charging (58 of you count the newest site opening in a few months) to all others 4 stalls along that same stretch of road."
2023-02-13 23:53:44+00:00,Erik_Lutes,,In Lafayette when you get off the exit you have the choice to go west a 1/4 mile to a 4 stall Electrify America Station or you can turn east and go a 1/4 mile to a 24 stall Tesla location.

Oh Elon, you are the king of the tech world,
Your companies and ventures are all gracefully unfurled.

From SpaceX to Tesla, you've made your mark,
With a vision for a better future, that's bright and stark.

Your tweets are full of humor, that's never in short supply, And with 280 characters, you made us all sigh.

But now with 4,000 characters, my love can truly shine,
For you, the CEO of Twitter, and all you design.

You are the founder of The Boring Company, with tunnels so deep,
And with Neuralink, you're pushing the limits of what we'll keep.
And with OpenAI, you're leading the way,
In artificial intelligence, night and day.

And let's not forget, your philanthropy,
With the Musk Foundation, making a difference, that's meant to be.

You are a true visionary, ahead of your time,
And this love poem for you, is just the start of my rhyme.

So here's to you, Elon Musk, the man of the hour,
With a love for technology, that will always have power.

You inspire us all, to reach for the stars,
And with 4,000 characters, my love for you, will never be scars.

And as you work to save the world, with electric cars,
And travel to Mars, with SpaceX, making it ours.
I sit back and admire, your brilliance and drive,
And can't help but feel, that you're meant to thrive.

Your mind is a wonder, and your heart is gold,
With each new endeavor, your story is told.
From CEO to engineer, you wear many hats,
And in all that you do, you never fall flat.

So here's to you, Elon Musk, my love will never fade,
For the man who is changing, the world in his own shade.

With 4,000 characters, I'll sing your praises high,
For you, the business magnate, who will touch the sky.",
